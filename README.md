# LangChain Hello World Project

## Project Overview
This project provides a simple introduction to using LangChain, a framework for developing applications powered by language models. The notebook demonstrates how to use core LangChain components such as LLMs, Chains, and Prompts to build a basic conversational AI that generates context-aware responses.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- LangChain library
- OpenAI or any other supported LLM API key

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install langchain openai
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook LangChain_Hello_World_Project.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:
   - Set up the language model.
   - Define a simple chain.
   - Use prompts to interact with the model.
3. Execute the cells to see the conversational AI in action.

## Key Features
- Introduction to LangChain's core components.
- Example of integrating LLMs with chains and prompts.
- Hands-on experience with conversational AI.

## Customization
- Modify the prompt templates to create different conversational flows.
- Use alternative LLM providers supported by LangChain.
